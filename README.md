# DGMD-E58-Project

This is a repository for a Harvard course (Design of Computational Media for Formal and Informal Learning) project. 

The idea is to build a computational media tool using Framer. I am using NBA statistics from the 2020-21 season to create a UI that allows the user to pick a team and player and visualize their shot chart and see their statistics for a given game.
